## Test details:

 * Attempt deadline: by 31.05.2023.

## Nest steps:

 * Read the readme text carefully
 * The exercise doesn’t have to be done in a perfect way, just do your best and prioritize the most important components first
 * Once done – share the code in a compressed file via WeTransfer and send it by email
 * After test submission there will be a test assessment, results should be shared in less than two weeks (typically one week)

## Please remember to:

 * Use all your knowledge and best practices at maximum
 * Include all your logs in the final package
 * Do not put your name anywhere in comments or file names (anonymous assessment)
 * Copying parts or complete code is forbidden! That’s a solo test.

## Challenge Guideline

This is meant to be an assignment that you spend approximately two to three hours of focused coding. Do not feel that you need to spend extra time to make a good impression.  Smaller amounts of high quality code will let us have a much better conversation than large amounts of low quality code.
Think of this like an open source project. Create a repo on Github, use git for source control, and use a Readme file to document what you built for the newcomer to your project.
We build systems engineered to run in production. Given this, please organize, design, test, deploy, and document your solution as if you were going to put it into production. We completely understand this might mean you can't do much in the time budget. Prioritize production-readiness over features.
Think out loud in your documentation. Write our tradeoffs, the thoughts behind your choices, or things you would do or do differently if you were able to spend more time on the project or do it a second time.
We have a variety of languages and frameworks that we use at Estee Lauder Companies, but we don't expect you to know them ahead of time. For this assignment you can make whatever choices that let you express the best solution to the problem given your knowledge and favorite tools without any restriction. Please make sure to document how to get started with your solution in terms of setup so that we'd be able to run it.
Once this is functioning and documented to your liking, compress the project directory, give the file a pithy name which includes your own name, and return the compressed directory to your recruiter or HR contact.
 

## The Challenge

As the doo-da man says, "you've got to play your hand", and in this case your hand is to implement this food truck app.

Our team loves to eat. They are also a team that loves variety, so they also like to discover new places to eat.

In fact, we have a particular affection for food trucks. One of the great things about Food Trucks in San Francisco is that the city releases a list of them as open data.

Your assignment is to make it possible for our teams to do something with this food trucks data.

This is a freeform assignment. You can write a web API that returns a set of food trucks. You can write a web frontend that visualizes the nearby food trucks for a given place. You can create a CLI that lets us get the names of all the taco trucks in the city. You're not limited by these ideas at all, but hopefully those are enough help spark your own creativity.

San Francisco's food truck open dataset is https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data and there is an endpoint with a https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/rqzj-sfat/rows.csv

We've also included a copy of the data in this repo as well.
